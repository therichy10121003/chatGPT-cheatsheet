### Overview of ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a computer program that can understand and generate human-like language to have conversations with people.

> _This is the answer I got when I asked ChatGPT to explain itself in one sentence to someone who knows nothing about ChatGPT or AI._

How about a more specific definition?

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art, large-scale natural language processing model based on the Transformer architecture, which can generate human-like text and perform various language-related tasks with high accuracy.

> _This time, I asked ChatGPT to sum itself up in one sentence to an AI and machine learning expert. Pretty cool, right?_

But ... what are AI and machine learning?

**AI (Artificial Intelligence)** is a type of computer technology that allows machines to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. **Machine Learning** is a subset of AI that enables machines to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. So in relation to AI and machine learning, ChatGPT is a particular machine learning model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data to generate human-like responses and carry out natural language processing tasks.

There are a few different ways to look at ChatGPT. Here are a few metaphors I like:

#### <u>ChatGPT is like a very tech-savvy intern</u>

It's helpful when assisting you in work that you can do on your own but might be too repetitive or time-consuming. If you feel comfortable handing off work to ChatGPT that you can also fact-check and fine-tune on your own, you're in good hands.

#### <u>ChatGPT is like a Rabbi, Mullah, or Priest of the Internet</u>

If the Internet is its sacred text, ChatGPT interprets and conveys information available on the Internet in a way that's easy to read and digest for as many people as possible. This communication can help visualize and break-down complicated or abstract ideas, but it should be taken with a grain of salt and should not be a substitute for your own knowledge.

#### <u>ChatGPT is like a very knowledgeable person (but not a smart person)</u>

ChatGPT's access to information is impressive, but dumb questions will not always yield smart answers; ChatGPT will not be able to always figure out the intent or context of your questions unless you explicitly tell it so. This is where the famous expression "garbage in, garbage out" comes into play.

### Project goals and intended audience

The goal of this guide is to establish foundational knowledge of ChatGPT and some basic concepts behind AI and machine learning. This could be your first-ever guide to ChatGPT, whether you're a non-developer using the popular chat functionality or a developer using OpenAI's API to build your first ChatGPT app.

## II. Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

[Return to top](#top)

### System requirements

ChatGPT

- [A free OpenAI account](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt)
- A web browser & secure internet

Mac

- macOS 10.15 or later
- At least 4GB of RAM
- 2GHz Intel Core i5 or equivalent CPU

Windows:

- Windows 10 or later
- At least 4GB of RAM
- 2GHz Intel Core i5 or equivalent CPU

Linux:

- Ubuntu 18.04 or later, or a similar Linux distribution
- At least 4GB of RAM
- 2GHz Intel Core i5 or equivalent CPU

> _NOTE: For the sake of simplicity and accessibility, we'll be sticking to using GPT-3. GPT-4 is available now but only in beta; this guide will be updated once GPT-4 and future versions are more widely available._ > _IMPORTANT: Be mindful of everything you ask and send to ChatGPT. Do not share private information that you would not want ChatGPT to remember and store._

### Installing dependencies

Both chatbot example files found in this guide are written in Python, so you'll need to download the latest versions of the following:

- [Python](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/build-your-application)
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) (and make sure to [create your secret API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
- [Gradio](https://gradio.app/quickstart/) (the UI library I'm using to locally deploy our chatbot)
- [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) (to keep my OpenAI API key hidden!)

As of this writing, I'm using the API model version "gpt-3.5-turbo," though this may be updated in a future release.

> _Though this repo focuses on Python, you can use OpenAI's API in other languages. For example, [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO1mwxPNP5A) has a great video on using ChatGPT to build a "Hello, World" React app, and [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qNwoAAfnk4) made a great video going over the basics of creating a chatbot with vanilla JavaScript._

### Running the code

In either .py file, in the terminal, run the python command and the name of the file to start the app:

`python chat_cli.py`

or

`python chat_ui.py`

The terminal will provide next steps for you and how to view your results.

When you wish to exit out of the chat to then restart the program, on your keyboard, click `control + c`.

### Natural Language Programming

- I need a REST API built with Rust. It should have products with the fields of id, name, description, and category_id. The category_id should have a relationship with another resource called categories. Categories should have an id and a name field. Let's use an SQLite database. Use any frameworks and libraries that you see fit. ([Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_joulYVndM))

  - Can you rewrite this code using TailwindCSS?
  - When I click on the button, send an HTTP request to /api/products. Instead of the fetch API, use Axios. ([Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTeoEFzVNSc))
- I need the HTML and CSS in separate files for a blog homepage with a navbar with a logo on the left and links on the right. A hero area with a background image and centered text. Under that should be 3 cards in a horizontal flexbox. The cards should have light gray background and a box shadow. Use light blues and greens and use the poppies font. ([Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_joulYVndM))

### React Examples
